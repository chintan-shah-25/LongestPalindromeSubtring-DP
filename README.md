LongestPalindromeSubtring-DP
============================
Given a string, find the longest substring which is palindrome. For example, if the given string is “bbcdmdca”, the output should be “cdmdc”. This can be solved with brute force but its complexity would be O(n^3). We can solve this problem using dynamic programming in O(n^2) time. See the java file for implementation and algorithm.
